-   We've always fooled around together since we were kids.
    
-   We've shared the most exciting moments, but every story has an end.
    
-   No one can stay a kid forever.
    
-   Time moves on, and people grow up.
    
-   We must go our separate ways.
    
-   You must keep going even after I'm gone.
